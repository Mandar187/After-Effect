# 🌀 After Effects - The Chaos Edit Collection  
Welcome to the graveyard of my brain cells, where keyframes are cursed and motion blur hides my sins.

> Made with pain, caffeine, and a GPU that's begging for mercy.  
> **Viewer discretion advised** (Some animations may cause excessive inspiration or confusion).

## 🎬 Contents from the Abyss:

### 🚗 CarEdit & TechnologiaCarEdit  
Instagram-style edits, but darker.  
Where tires spin, lights flicker, and the beat hits harder than your ex's last words.

---

### 🏎️ CarRace  
My first dance with shape layers.  
They move, they shake, they race. Chaos in minimalism — and it somehow works.

---

### 🏆 CarsPodium  
A parallax experiment so deep, even Inception would be like: "yo chill."  
Cars flex on a podium like they just won the Hunger Games.

---

### 👁️ SciFiHUD  
A futuristic UI animation.  
Feels like Jarvis had a nightmare and decided to haunt Adobe After Effects.

---

### 🧠 TextAnim  
Practicing all 12 principles of animation — because who needs sleep when you can squash & stretch your sanity?

---

### 🎮 ValorantTitleSequence  
A title sequence darker than Viper’s backstory.  
Custom made for Valorant — glitchy, moody, and slightly unstable (like me 😈).

GitHub screamed at me: “File size too big.”
